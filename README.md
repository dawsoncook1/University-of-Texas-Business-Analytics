My projects as a Masters student. Will continue to add projects!  

Data Analytics Programming: Analyzed significance of race and patient satisfaction in relation to iatrogenesis rates in California counties.

Predictive Modeling: Analyzed 3 years of loan data(10,000+ observations and 38 variables) to predict loan default rate.

Text Analysis: 
  Assignment 1: Created web scraper to retrieve data from Edmunds car forum. Identified top 10 brands by frequency and calculated       lift ratios for associations between the brands. Then programmed a multi-dimensional scaling map to show brand to brand               association. Used word frequency counter to find the top attributes, and used lift analysis to find the most strongly associated     attributes in respect to the top brands. Repeated process for aspirational words.
  
  Assignment 2: Created web scraper to retrieve data from beer advocates forum. Performed a similarity analysis using cosine           similarity with the 3 attributes specified by the customer and the reviews. Conducted feature level sentiment analysis for each of   our three features. Created an evaluation score(for recommendations) for each of the three features using cosine similarity and       spacy similarity.
  
  Assignment 3: Scraped about 5,000 instagram posts, and using the image URLs, obtained image labels from Google Vision cloud.         Created   a metric for engagement by using a weighted sum of # likes and # comments. Implemented TF-IDF scores, and ran a logistic   regression   with engagement as the dependent variable, and the image labels as independent variables. Also ran a logistic           regression with engagement as the dependent variable, and the image captions as independent variables, and combined                   captions and labels and repeated the process. Lastly, performed topic modeling (LDA) on the image labels.
